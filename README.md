# Exchange-rate-forecast-based-on-EMD-and-BP
BP is used for time series modeling of exchange rate prediction. For the correlation problems in the sequence, EMD is used to decompose the original sequence, then each subsequence is decomposed to establish a BP model, and finally the prediction results of each subsequence are added as the final result
采用BP进行汇率预测的时间序列建模，针对序列中存在的相关性问题，采用EMD对原始序列进行分解，然后对各子序列分解建立BP模型，最终将各子序列的预测结果相加作为最终的结果
